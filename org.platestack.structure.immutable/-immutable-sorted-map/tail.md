# tail

`abstract fun tail(fromKey: K): `[`ImmutableSortedMap`](index.md)`<K, V>`

Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are
greater than or equal to `fromKey`.  The returned map is
backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are
reflected in this map, and vice-versa.  The returned map
supports all optional map operations that this map supports.

The returned map will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`
on an attempt to insert a key outside its range.

### Parameters

`fromKey` - low endpoint (inclusive) of the keys in the returned map

### Exceptions

`ClassCastException` - if `fromKey` is not compatible
    with this map's comparator (or, if the map has no comparator,
    if `fromKey` does not implement [Comparable](#)).
    Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this
    exception if `fromKey` cannot be compared to keys
    currently in the map.

`NullPointerException` - if `fromKey` is null and
    this map does not permit null keys

`IllegalArgumentException` - if this map itself has a
    restricted range, and `fromKey` lies outside the
     bounds of the range

**Return**
a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater
    than or equal to `fromKey`
