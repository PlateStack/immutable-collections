# head

`abstract fun head(toKey: K): `[`ImmutableSortedMap`](index.md)`<K, V>`

Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are
strictly less than `toKey`.  The returned map is backed
by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in
this map, and vice-versa.  The returned map supports all
optional map operations that this map supports.

The returned map will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`
on an attempt to insert a key outside its range.

### Parameters

`toKey` - high endpoint (exclusive) of the keys in the returned map

### Exceptions

`ClassCastException` - if `toKey` is not compatible
    with this map's comparator (or, if the map has no comparator,
    if `toKey` does not implement [Comparable](#)).
    Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this
    exception if `toKey` cannot be compared to keys
    currently in the map.

`NullPointerException` - if `toKey` is null and
    this map does not permit null keys

`IllegalArgumentException` - if this map itself has a
    restricted range, and `toKey` lies outside the
    bounds of the range

**Return**
a view of the portion of this map whose keys are strictly
    less than `toKey`
